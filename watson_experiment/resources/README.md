Task 1

For facial detection, the training datasets is from http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/fddb/
    More specifically, download & unzip the originalPics and FDDB-folds, put these two folder directly under resources/
    folder and you are good to go.

    The FDDB-folds contains annoation for the corresponding faces in the FDDB-folds folder, yet those annotation are in
    the shape of eclipse, rather than rectangle (as was desired by IBM watson). Thus a script to do the annotation transformation
    is necessary. For the details of how eclipse is drawn, see the dataset link.
